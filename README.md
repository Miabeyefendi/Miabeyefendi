## Hey, I'm Mustafa 👋

I build tools that automate the things nobody wants to do manually.

```python
class Miabeyefendi:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name       = "Mustafa"
        self.role       = "Automation & Scraping Developer"
        self.languages  = ["Python", "C++", "C#"]
        self.tools      = ["Playwright", "Selenium", "DevTools"]
        self.interests  = ["Reverse Engineering", "Browser Automation", "Stealth Bots"]
        self.education  = "MSc Graduate"
        self.location   = "Turkey"
        self.goal       = "Building useful open-source tools"
```

### 🔧 What I Build

I like taking things apart to understand how they work — then building tools around them.

- 🤖 **[Munliker](https://github.com/Miabeyefendi/Munliker)** — Stealth Instagram mass unlike bot with human behavior simulation & Samsung S24 Ultra emulation. Built with Playwright.
- 📨 **[InstaDM-Scraper](https://github.com/Miabeyefendi/InstaDM-Scraper)** — Browser console Instagram DM exporter. No API, no extensions — pure JS with virtual scroll support.

### 💡 Philosophy

> *I don't build products. I build solutions to problems that annoyed me enough to write code.*

I reverse-engineer platforms, understand their internal mechanics, and build automation tools that respect the boundary between useful and harmful. Everything I release is open-source and educational.
